### Introduction

> The **We are Poet** is a web based platform written in `Flask` and basics of `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`. In this platform, we use SQLite for easily handle the database. I've made some changes specially the backend of the platform. In this case, I used flask from NodeJS, just to practice the `SQL` and to fix some basic errors such as the SQL related attacks, as well as the Scripting based attacts, which I'm trying to learn more on how do I protect the data that the user given to me.
